# Closure Practice

Remember, a closure is a function that retains the state of its environment.
That makes it useful for tracking data as it changes over time, but it can
come at the cost of understandability.

When not to use the nonlocal keyword: when the variable is mutable
(such as a list, dictionary or set), and you are modifying its contents
rather than reassigning the variable. You only need the nonlocal keyword
if you are reassigning a variable instead of modifying its contents
(which you must do to change immutable values such as strings and integers).

Let's try a closure without the nonlocal keyword.

## Assignment

Complete the new_collection function.

It accepts a list of strings, initial_docs.

It should return a function that closes over a copy of initial_docs.
This function should accept a string, append that string to the closed-over
list, and return the new list.

Do not modify the original initial_docs list!

## Example Usage

```python
new_collection = new_collection(["doc1", "doc2", "doc3"])
print(new_collection("doc4"))
# ['doc1', 'doc2', 'doc3', 'doc4']
print(new_collection("doc5"))
# ['doc1', 'doc2', 'doc3', 'doc4', 'doc5']
```
