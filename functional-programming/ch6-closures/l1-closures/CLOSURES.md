# Closures

A closure is a function that references variables from outside its own
function body. The function definition and its environment are bundled
together into a single entity.

Put simply, a closure is just a function that keeps track of some values
from the place where it was defined, no matter where it is executed later on.

## Example

The concatter() function returns a function called doc_builder
(yay higher-order functions!) that has a reference to an enclosed doc value.

```python
def concatter():
	doc = ""
	def doc_builder(word):
		# "nonlocal" tells Python to use the 'doc'
		# variable from the enclosing scope
		nonlocal doc
		doc += word + " "
		return doc
	return doc_builder

# save the returned 'doc_builder' function
# to the new function 'harry_potter_aggregator'
harry_potter_aggregator = concatter()
harry_potter_aggregator("Mr.")
harry_potter_aggregator("and")
harry_potter_aggregator("Mrs.")
harry_potter_aggregator("Dursley")
harry_potter_aggregator("of")
harry_potter_aggregator("number")
harry_potter_aggregator("four,")
harry_potter_aggregator("Privet")

print(harry_potter_aggregator("Drive"))
# Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive
```

When concatter() is called, it creates a new "stateful" function
that remembers the value of its internal doc variable. Each successive
call to harry_potter_aggregator appends to that same doc.

## nonlocal

Python has a keyword called nonlocal that's required to modify a variable
from an enclosing scope. Most programming languages don't require this
keyword, but Python does.
